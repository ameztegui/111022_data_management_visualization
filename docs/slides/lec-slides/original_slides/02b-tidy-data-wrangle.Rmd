# Tidy data

## Tidy data

>Leo Tolstoy

.pull-left[
**Characteristics of tidy data:**

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.
]
--
.pull-right[
**Characteristics of untidy data:**

!@#$%^&*()
]

## Summary tables 

.question[
Is each of the following a dataset or a summary table?
]

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars %>%
  select(name, height, mass) %>%
  datatable(options = list(dom = "pt", pageLength = 8))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars %>%
  count(homeworld, gender) %>%
  spread(gender, n) %>%
  datatable(options = list(dom = "pt", pageLength = 8))
```
]

# Pipes

---

## Where does the name come from?

The pipe operator is implemented in the package **magrittr**.

.pull-left[
![pipe](img/02b/magritte.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
![magrittr](img/02b/magrittr.jpg)
]

---

## Review: How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find key, 
unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.

- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

- Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

---

## What about other arguments?

To send results to a function argument other than first one or to use the previous result for multiple arguments, use `.`:

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  lm(mass ~ height, data = .)
```

## A Grammar of Data Manipulation

**dplyr** is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

Single data frame functions / verbs:

* `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
* `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
* `select`: pick columns by name
* `pull`: grab a column as a vector
* `rename`: rename specific columns
* `arrange`: reorder rows
* `mutate`: add new variables
* `transmute`: create new data frame with variables
* `distinct`: filter for unique rows
* `sample_n` / `sample_frac`: randomly sample rows
* `summarise`: reduce variables to values
* ... (many more)

---

## **dplyr** rules for functions

1. First argument is *always* a data frame

2. Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

3. Always return a data frame

4. Don't modify in place

5. Performance via lazy evaluation

---

## A note on piping and layering

- The `%>%` operator in **dplyr** functions is called the pipe operator. This means you "pipe" the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code.

- The `+` operator in **ggplot2** functions is used for "layering". This means you create the plot in layers, separated by `+`.

---

## Filter rows with `filter`

- Select a subset of rows in a data frame.
- Easily filter for many conditions at once.

---

## `filter`

for crashes in Durham County

```{r}
bike %>%
  filter(County == "Durham")
```

---

## `filter`

for crashes in Durham County where biker was < 10 yrs old

```{r}
bike %>%
  filter(County == "Durham", Bike_Age < 10)
```

---

## Commonly used logical operators in R

operator    | definition                   || operator     | definition
------------|------------------------------||--------------|----------------
`<`         | less than                    ||`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y` 
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        ||`is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`
`>`         | greater than                 ||`!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`
`>=`        |	greater than or equal to     ||`x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`
`==`        |	exactly equal to             ||`!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y`
`!=`        |	not equal to                 ||`!x`          | not `x`
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  ||              |

## Aside: real data is messy!

.question[
What in the world does a `BikeAge_gr` of `10-Jun` or `15-Nov` mean?
]

.small[
```{r}
bike %>%
  group_by(BikeAge_Gr) %>%
  summarise(crash_count = n())
```
]

---

## Careful data scientists clean up their data first!

- We're going to need to do some text parsing to clean up
these data
    + `10-Jun` should be `6-10`
    + `15-Nov` should be `11-15`

---

## Correct and overwrite `mutate`

- Remember we want to do the following in the `BikeAge_Gr` variable
    + `10-Jun` should be `6-10`
    + `15-Nov` should be `11-15`
 
```{r}
bike <- bike %>%
  mutate(BikeAge_Gr = case_when(
    BikeAge_Gr == "10-Jun" ~ "6-10",
    BikeAge_Gr == "15-Nov" ~ "11-15",
    TRUE                   ~ BikeAge_Gr     # everything else
  ))
```

- Note that we're overwriting existing data and columns, so be careful!
    + But remember, it's easy to revert if you make a mistake since we didn't
    touch the raw data, we can always reload it and start over

---

## Check before you move on

Always check your changes and confirm code did what you wanted it to do

```{r}
bike %>%
  group_by(BikeAge_Gr) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```

---

## `mutate` to add new variables

.question[
How is the new `alcohol` variable determined?
]

```{r eval=FALSE}
bike %>%
  mutate(alcohol = case_when(
    Bike_Alc_D == "No" & Drvr_Alc_D == "No"      ~ "No",
    Bike_Alc_D == "Yes" | Drvr_Alc_D == "Yes"    ~ "Yes",
    Bike_Alc_D == "Missing" & Drvr_Alc_D == "No" ~ "Missing",
    Bike_Alc_D == "No" & Drvr_Alc_D == "Missing" ~ "Missing"
  ))
```

---

## "Save" when you `mutate`

Most often when you define a new variable with `mutate` you'll also want to save the resulting data frame, often by writing over the original data frame.

```{r eval=FALSE}
bike <- bike %>%
  mutate(alcohol = case_when(
    Bike_Alc_D == "No" & Drvr_Alc_D == "No"      ~ "No",
    Bike_Alc_D == "Yes" | Drvr_Alc_D == "Yes"    ~ "Yes",
    Bike_Alc_D == "Missing" & Drvr_Alc_D == "No" ~ "Missing",
    Bike_Alc_D == "No" & Drvr_Alc_D == "Missing" ~ "Missing"
  ))
```

---

## `transmute` to create a new dataset

You'll use this much less often than `mutate` but when you need it, you need it.

```{r}
bike %>% 
  transmute(ID = paste(FID, OBJECTID, sep = "-"))
```

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

First five
```{r}
bike %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

Last five
```{r}
last_row <- nrow(bike)
bike %>%
  slice((last_row - 4):last_row)
```

---

## `select` to keep only the variables you mention

```{r}
bike %>%
  select(Crash_Loc, Hit_Run) %>%
  table()
```

---

## or `select` to exclude variables

```{r}
bike %>%
  select(-OBJECTID)
```

---

## or `select` a range of variables

```{r}
bike %>%
  select(OBJECTID:Bike_Injur)
```

---

## `pull` to extract a column as a vector

```{r}
bike %>%
  slice(1:6) %>%
  pull(Location)
```

```{r}
bike %>%
  slice(1:6) %>%
  select(Location)
```

---

## The two `pull`s in your lives

.pull-left[
![pipe](img/02b/hex-dplyr.png)
]
.pull-right[
![magrittr](img/02b/Octocat.png)
]

- Don't get `pull` happy when wrangling data! Only extract out variables if you truly need to, otherwise keep in data frame.

- But always `r emo::ji("arrow_down")` `Pull` before starting your work when collaborating on GitHub.

---

## `rename` specific columns

Useful for correcting typos, and renaming to make variable names shorter 
and/or more informative

- Original names:
.small[
```{r}
names(bike)
```
]

- Rename `Speed_Limi` to `Speed_Limit`:
```{r}
bike <- bike %>%
  rename(Speed_Limit = Speed_Limi)
```

---

## Check before you move on

Always check your changes and confirm code did what you wanted it to do

.small[
```{r}
names(bike)
```
]

---

## `summarise` to reduce variables to values

The values are summarised in a data frame

```{r}
bike %>%
  group_by(BikeAge_Gr) %>%
  summarise(crash_count = n())
```

---

## and `arrange` to order rows

```{r}
bike %>%
  group_by(BikeAge_Gr) %>%
  summarise(crash_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(crash_count))
```

---

## `count` to group by then count

.small[
```{r}
bike %>%
  count(BikeAge_Gr)
```
]

.question[
If you wanted to arrange these in ascending order what would you add to the pipe?
]

---

## Select rows with `sample_n` or `sample_frac`

- `sample_n`: randomly sample 5 observations

```{r}
bike_n5 <- bike %>%
  sample_n(5, replace = FALSE)
dim(bike_n5)
```

- `sample_frac`: randomly sample 20% of observations

```{r}
bike_perc20 <-bike %>%
  sample_frac(0.2, replace = FALSE)
dim(bike_perc20)
```

---

## `distinct` to filter for unique rows

```{r}
bike %>% 
  select(County, City) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(County, City)
```
