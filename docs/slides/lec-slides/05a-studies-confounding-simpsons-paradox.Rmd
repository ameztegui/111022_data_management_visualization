# Scientific studies

---

## Scientific studies

- Observational
    - Collect data in a way that does not interfere with how the data arise ("observe")
    - Only establish an association

- Experimental
    - Randomly assign subjects to treatments
    - Establish causal connections

.question[
Design a study comparing average energy levels of people who do and do not exercise -- both as an observational study and as an experiment.

## Study: Bfast cereal keeps girls slim

Girls who ate breakfast of any type had a lower average body mass index, a common obesity gauge, than those who said they didn't. The index was even lower for girls who said they ate cereal for breakfast, according to findings of the study conducted by the Maryland Medical Research Institute with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and cereal-maker General Mills.
 
[...]
 
The results were gleaned from a larger NIH survey of 2,379 girls in California, Ohio, and Maryland who were tracked between the ages of 9 and 19.
 
[...]
 
As part of the survey, the girls were asked once a year what they had eaten during the previous three days.
 
[...]

.question[
What is the explanatory and what is the response variable?
]

---

### 3 possible explanations

--

1. Eating breakfast causes girls to be slimmer 

--

2. Being slim causes girls to eat breakfast

--

3. A third variable is responsible for both -- a **confounding** variable: an extraneous variable that affects both the explanatory and the response variable, and that make it seem like there is a relationship between them

# Conditional probability

## Conditional probability

**Notation**: $P(A | B)$: Probability of event A given event B

- What is the probability that it be unseasonably warm tomorrow?

- What is the probability that it be unseasonably warm tomorrow, given that it it was unseasonably warm tomorrow?

.question[
Given that

- $P(Very) = \frac{122}{500} = 0.244$
- $P(Very~|~18-49) = \frac{90}{316} = 0.285$
- $P(Very~|~50+) = \frac{32}{184} = 0.173$

does there appear to be a relationship between age and familiarity with the DREAM act? Explain your reasoning.
]

--

<br>

.question[
Could there be another variable that explains this relationship?
]

---

## Independence

.question[
Inspired by the previous example and how we used the conditional probabilities to make conclusions, come up with a definition of independent events. If easier, you can keep the context limited to the example (independence/dependence of familiarity with the DREAM act and age), but try to push yourself to make a more general statement.

# Simpson's paradox

---

## Relationships between variables

- Bivariate relationship: Fitness -> Heart health

- Multivariate relationship: Calories + Age + Fitness -> Heart health

---

## Simpson's paradox

- Not considering an important variable when studying a relationship can result in what we call a **Simpson's paradox**, which illustrates the effect the omission of an explanatory variable can have on the measure of association between another explanatory variable and a response variable. 

- In other words, the inclusion of a third variable in the analysis can change the apparent relationship between the other two variables.

## Berkeley admission data

- Study carried out by the graduate Division of the University of California, Berkeley in the early 70’s to evaluate whether there was a sex bias in graduate admissions

- The data come from six departments. For confidentiality we'll call them A-F. 

- We have information on whether the applicant was male or female and whether they were admitted or rejected. 

- First, we will evaluate whether the percentage of males admitted is indeed higher than females, overall. Next, we will calculate the same percentage for each department.

## Data

```{r message=FALSE}
ucb_admit <- read_csv("data/ucb_admit.csv")
ucb_admit
```

## Glimpse at the data

```{r message=FALSE}

## Overall gender distribution

.question[
What can you say about the overall gender distribution? Hint: Calculate the following probabilities: $P(Admit | Male)$ and $P(Admit | Female)$.
]

```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  count(Gender, Admit)
```

## Overall gender distribution

.question[
What type of visualization would be appropriate for representing these data?

## Gender distribution, by department

# What else do I need to know from this week's reading?

---

## Short answer

Everything `r emo::ji("stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye")`

---

## Long answer

Be able to identify

# Coding style

---

## Style guide

>"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."
>
>Hadley Wickham

- Style guide for this course is based on the Tidyverse style guide: http://style.tidyverse.org/

- There's more to it than what we'll cover today, but we'll mention more as we introduce more functionality, and do a recap later in the semester

---

## File names and code chunk labels

- Do not use spaces in file names, use `-` or `_` to separate words
- Use all lowercase letters

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ucb-admit.csv

# Bad
UCB Admit.csv
```

---

## Object names

- Use `_` to separate words in object names
- Use informative but short object names
- Do not reuse object names within an analysis

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
acs_employed

# Bad
acs.employed
acs2
acs_subset
acs_subsetted_for_males
```

---

## Spacing

- Put a space before and after all infix operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.), and when naming arguments in function calls. 
- Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

---

## ggplot

- Always end a line with `+`
- Always indent the next line

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Bad
ggplot(diamonds,mapping=aes(x=price))+geom_histogram()
```

---

## Long lines

- Limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font.

- Take advantage of RStudio editor's auto formatting for indentation at line breaks.

---

## Assignment

- Use `<-` not `=`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
x <- 2

# Bad
x = 2
```

---

## Quotes

Use `"`, not `'`, for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  # Good
  labs(title = "`Shine bright like a diamond`",
  # Good
       x = "Diamond prices",
  # Bad
       y = 'Frequency')
```
