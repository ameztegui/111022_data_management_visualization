      <description>Class: Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. Programming is a skill that is best learned by doing, so as much as possible you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class.
Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusiveness: It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students&#39; learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.</description>
