## My favorite TV series
It is very difficult to define our favorite series, there are so many good ones! It may be easier if we separate into **drama** and **commedies**.

### My favorite drama TV series

1. Breaking bad
2. The West Wing
3. Northern Exposure
4. Game of Thrones

### My favorite TV commedy series
In the case of commedies, I couldn`t possible rank them, but *among* my favorite commedies I can cite:

- Monty Python Flying Circus
- The Office
    - The Office UK version
    - The Office US versionR Markdown is so nice!
- Seinfeld

### Finding new series
To find new series to watch, I often check in [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/)
Based on the ratings, this may be the next series I watch:
