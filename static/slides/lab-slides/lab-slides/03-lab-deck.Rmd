## Agenda

1. **An example of the power of visualization:** 
2. **Git wisdom**
3. **Lab introduction**
4. **Starting a new project:** Clone the repo into a new RStudio Cloud project.

## The importance of visualization

- What do these guys have in common?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/John_Snow.jpg"); knitr::include_graphics("img/03/John_Snow-got.jpg")
```

---

- They're both named John Snow, but only one of them was involved with the 1854 Broad Street London cholera outbreak

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/Snow-cholera-map.jpg")
```
---

## Git

- Git commands should be used with intent

- During lab, try to avoid this: "I'm confused; let's see if clicking this fixes anything" (ask me, or talk with teammates)

- When not in lab, (careful) experimentation is totally encouraged!

- Bottom line: understand *why* a command does what it does.

---

## Lab introduction
The next two labs are motivated by:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="220px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/Dennys.png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/LaQuinta.jpg")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="220px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/texas-flag.png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/mitch-hedberg.jpg")
```

## Starting a new project

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the lab-03 repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and hit OK.

- Follow the instructions to configure your git credentials. To double check, run the following 
commands and make sure your info is correct:

```
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```
- Install the `tidyverse` package and make sure it's being loaded in your Lab .Rmd.
