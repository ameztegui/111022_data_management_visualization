- R is a true “data language"
{{content}}


--

- But very versatile
{{content}}


--

- Multiplatform
{{content}}


--

- 100% free (in both senses)
{{content}}


--

- Analyses conducted in R are transparent, easily shareable, and reproducible
{{content}}


--

- Come for the stats, stay for the huuuuuge support community

.pull-right[</br>![](img/rstudio_logo.png)
{{content}}
]

--

- It is an integrated development environment (IDE). That means that any code block or instruction will work in any other R environment
{{content}}

--

- RStudio is the most convenient IDE. It has a more user-friendly interface, and comes with many other useful tools:
{{content}}
--
  - Autocomplete instructions
  - Object management
  - Data display and visualization
  - Data import
  - Exporting plots and figures
  - Many more, increasing every day

# Course structure and policies

---

# Class meetings

- Fully online

- Asynchronous

- There will be some lectures, introducing some basic concepts (via short videos) 

- The course is based on a hands-on approach --> lots of learn-by-doing

</br></br></br></br></br>
.center[**All the info, links and materials will be posted at </br>[datamanagement.netlify.app](https://datamanagement.netlify.app)**]

# Course components

<i class="fa fa-laptop  fa-lg"></i> .bold[Lectures:] only a few, but some "theory" will be needed. 

--

<i class="fa fa-code  fa-lg"></i> .bold[Labs:] 
- They're self paced tutorials with examples
- There will be some questions/exercises you will need to answer, by creating a "lab report" (we'll see how). 

--


<i class="fa fa-book fa-lg"></i> .bold[Readings:] In some lectures we will recommend some external readings to expand or consolidate concepts seen in class

--

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o fa-lg"></i>.bold[Homework:] Individual. They will consist in short data science problems aimed at fixing and applying all the contents included in the labs.

--

<i class="fa fa-check-square fa-lg"></i> .bold[Exams:] Individual, two  midterms. We will ask you to complete a number of small programming and or analysis tasks related to the material presented in the class. We have to set some time during the course to do them.

--

<i class="fa fa-question fa-lg"></i> .bold[Office hours:] we strongly encourage that you <u>learn how to get help</u> from the R community. You can also use the virtual campus forum tool. If some concepts are not fully understood by most of you, we can organize virtual "office hours".

# Grading

```{r echo=F}
grading <- data.frame(Component = c("Labs",
                                    "Homework",
                                    "Midterm 1",
                                    "Midterm 2"),
                      Weight = c("30%",
                                 "30%",
                                 "20%",
                                 "20%"))

# How to get help

- Course content, logistics, etc. are available at [datamanagement.netlify.app/](https://datamanagement.netlify.app/). 

- As we said, one of the best things about R is its community. Some highly recommended resources are:

  - [R bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/): A website dedicated to R development of tutorials.
  - [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/): Website devoted to questions-and-answers on programming languages among which is R also available.
  - [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/search?q=&facets%5Btechnology%5D%5B%5D=R): Interactive data science tutorials covering many topics. Some are paid.
  - [RStudio Online Learning](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/): A wealth of tutorials, articles, and examples developed by RStudio to help you learn R and its extensions.
  - [R-Tutor](http://www.r-tutor.com/): A website devoted to teach statistics. An useful one if you are not much familiar with basic statistical methods.
  
It is <u>important to become familiar</u> from the beginning with the various alternatives for <b>getting help</b>. A key part of your success in using R lies in your ability to be self-relient and be able to get help and apply it to your own problems.

# But... a note on sharing/reusing code

- A huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.

- Unless we explicitly tell you not to use something, the course's policy is that *you may make use of any online resources* (e.g. StackOverflow) but if you copy pieces of code from somewhere **you must cite** where you obtained it.

- Except for the exams, you are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not directly send or make **use of code from another student** in this class 

- On the exams all communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

# Your turn!

# Join RStudio cloud. Why?

.pull-left[
![](img/rstudiocloud.jpg)
{{content}}
]
--
- RStudio Cloud is a cloud managed instance of the RStudio IDE
{{content}}

--

- Reduces friction at first exposure to R
{{content}}

--

- Avoid the need for software local installation, usually painful
{{content}}

--

- No need to install packages, circulate files with data or download files
{{content}}

--

**Go to [https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/27211](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/27211), and log in (or sign up)**

# Create your first data visualization

- Once you log on to RStudio Cloud, click on this course's workspace "111022 Data Management and Visualization"

- You should see a project called `UN Votes`

- When you open the project (it may take a while), you will see a red prompt saying 'TEMPORARY COPY' and just beside, the option to 'Save a permanent copy'. Whenever you open a project created by us, the **FIRST THING TO DO** is create your own copy. Otherwise, all the changes you make will be lost when you log out.

- In the case of assignments, when you click "Start assignment", it automatically creates the copy in your space.

- I can access your own copies of projects, and even edit them or make comments. I have used this tool in previous editions of the course, and I got a very good feedback from students, it is a very convenient way of working with no file exchange.

---

# Create your first data visualization

- In the `Files` pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `UN_votes.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.

- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- I'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.

- Then change the country names to those you're interested in. Your spelling and capitalization should match the data so take a peek at the Appendix to see how the country names are spelled. Knit again. 


And voila, your first data visualization!
