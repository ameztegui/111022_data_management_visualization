# The "key" for joining data frames

- The variables used to connect each pair of tables are called **keys**.

- A key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation. For example, each plot is uniquely identified by its `Codi`. 

- In other cases, multiple variables may be needed. For example, to identify an observation in `trees` you need four variables: `Codi`, `Especie`, `Rumbo`, and `Dist`

---

# The "key" for joining data frames

There are two types of keys:

* A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. For example, `plots$Codi` is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each IFN plot in the `plots` table.

* A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, `trees$Codi` is a foreign key because it appears in the `trees` table where it matches each tree to a unique plot.

# The "key" for joining data frames

There are two types of keys:

* A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. For example, `plots$Codi` is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each IFN plot in the `plots` table.

* A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, `trees$Codi` is a foreign key because it appears in the `trees` table where it matches each tree to a unique plot.

To verify that they do indeed uniquely identify each observation. One way to do that is to `count()` the primary keys and look for entries where `n` is greater than one

```{r}
plots %>% 
  count(Codi) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```
