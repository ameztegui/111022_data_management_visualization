# Hypothesis testing for a single proportion

---

## Packages


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
```


---

# From last time - Testing for independence

---

## Study results


```r
mb_yawn &lt;- read_csv("data/mb-yawn.csv")
```

.small[

```r
mb_yawn %&gt;%
  count(group, outcome) %&gt;%
  group_by(group) %&gt;%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 4
## # Groups:   group [2]
##   group     outcome      n p_hat
##   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 control   not yawn    12 0.750
## 2 control   yawn         4 0.250
## 3 treatment not yawn    24 0.706
## 4 treatment yawn        10 0.294
```
]

Difference in proportions of yawners: 

`\(\hat{p}_{treatment} - \hat{p}_{control} = 0.2941 - 0.25 = 0.0441\)`

---

## Two competing claims

- "There is nothing going on." 
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **independent**, yawning is not contagious, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. `\(\rightarrow\)` Null hypothesis

- "There is something going on."
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **dependent**, yawning is contagious, observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. `\(\rightarrow\)` Alternative hypothesis

---

## Running the simulation

1. Shuffle the 50 cards at least 7 times&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to ensure that the cards counted out are from a random process.

2. Count out the top 16 cards and set them aside. These cards represent the people in the control group.

3. Out of the remaining 34 cards (treatment group) count the \red{number of face cards} (the number of people who yawned in the treatment group).

4. Calculate the difference in proportions of yawners (treatment - control), and plot it 
on the board.

5. Mark the difference you find on the dot plot on the board.

## Simulation by hand

.question[
👥 Do the simulation results suggest that yawning 
is contagious, i.e. does seeing someone yawn and yawning appear to be dependent?

## Simulation by computation


```r
null_dist &lt;- mb_yawn %&gt;%
  specify(response = outcome, explanatory = group,

## Visualizing the null distribution

.question[
👤 What would you expect the center of the 
null distribution to be?
]

--


```r
ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) +
  labs(title = "Null distribution")
```

## Calculating the p-value, visually

.question[
👥 What is the p-value, i.e. in what % of the 
simulations was the simulated difference in sample proportion at least as extreme 
as the observed difference in sample proportions?
]

![](09b-sim-inf_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Calculating the p-value, directly


```r
null_dist %&gt;%
  filter(stat &gt;= 0.0441) %&gt;%
  summarise(p_value = n()/nrow(null_dist))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1

# Inference overview

## What do you want to do?

- Estimation -&gt; Confidence interval

- Decision -&gt; Hypothesis test

- First step: Ask the following questions

  1. How many variables?
  2. What types of variables?
  3. What is the research question?

---

class: center, middle

# Confidence intervals

---

## Confidence intervals

- Bootstrap

- Bounds: cutoff values for the middle XX% of the distribution

- Interpretation: We are XX% confident that the true population parameter is in the interval.

- Definition of confidence level: XX% of random samples of size n are expected to produce confidence intervals that contain the true population parameter.

- `infer::generate(reps, type = "bootstrap")`

---

## Confidence intervals exercises

.small[
.question[
👥 Describe the simulation process for estimating the parameter assigned to your team.

- Note any assumptions you make in terms of sample size, observed sample statistic, etc.
- Imagine using index cards or chips to represent the data. 
- Specify whether the simulation type would be bootstrap, simulate, or permute.

&gt; **Panda Express, BME, get MECT, Duke Squirrels, Team Power:** single population median

&gt; **ACE, Kimchi Stew, Databaes, HJC, 23, 24/7, five squared:** single population proportion

&gt; **Team Untitled, R we done yet?, Blue Wombats, Cosmic:** difference between two population means

&gt; **InterstellR, Tequila Mockingbird, Sweeter than SugR:** difference between two population proportions

&gt; **The Data Wranglers, Git R Done, Migos, Six Squared:** single population standard deviation
]]

## Accuracy vs. precision

.question[
👥 What happens to the width of the confidence interval as the confidence level increases? Why? Should we always prefer a confidence interval with a higher confidence level?

## Equivalency of confidence and significance levels

- Two sided alternative HT with `\(\alpha\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` `\(CL = 1 - \alpha\)`
- One sided alternative HT with `\(\alpha\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` `\(CL = 1 - (2 \times \alpha)\)`

## Interpretation of confidence intervals

.question[
👤 Which of the following is more informative: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The difference in price of a gallon of milk between Whole Foods and Harris Teeter is 30 cents.
&lt;li&gt; A gallon of milk costs 30 cents more at Whole Foods compared to Harris Teeter.
&lt;/ul&gt;

## Testing errors

- Type 1: Reject `\(H_0\)` when you shouldn't have
    + P(Type 1 error) = `\(\alpha\)`
    
- Type 2: Fail to reject `\(H_0\)` when you should have
    + P(Type 2 error) is harder to calculate, but increases as `\(\alpha\)` decreases

.question[
👤 In a court of law

- Null hypothesis: Defendant is innocent
- Alternative hypothesis: Defendant is guilty

Which is worse: Type 1 or Type 2 error?
]

---

## Probabilities of testing errors

- P(Type 1 error) = `\(\alpha\)`

- P(Type 2 error) = 1 - Power

- Power = P(correctly rejecting the null hypothesis)

--

.question[
👥 Fill in the blanks in terms of correctly/incorrectly rejecting/failing to reject the null hypothesis:

- `\(\alpha\)` is the probability of ______.
- 1 - Power is the probability of ______.
