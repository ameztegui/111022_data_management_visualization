# What is a model?

## model (noun) 
.left[.footnote[Source: Cambridge Dictionary]]

--
1. Something that a copy can be based on because it is an extremely good example of its type

2. A person who wears clothes so that they can be photographed or shown to possible buyers, or a person who is employed to be photographed or painted

3. A particular type of machine, especially a car, that is slightly different from machines of the same type

4. Something that represents another thing, either as a physical object that is usually smaller than the real object, or as a simple description that can be used in calculations.

## Models can be used for different purposes...*

</br>
1. Synthesize existing knowledge

2. Forecast future conditions

3. Examine the fundamental behavior of a system

4. Identify gaps in current knowledge and guide future research

5. Generate hypotheses

####individual-based models in which agents can't move (trees) combine elements of mechanistic models with empirical constraints (e.g. on growth, tree size, mortality) to ensure usefulness for operational decisions

- Useful for operational decision
- Somewhat easier to parameterize
- Data availability
