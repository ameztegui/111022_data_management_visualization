## Agenda

1. Reminder: Midterm
2. Lab 05: Simpson's Paradox
3. Getting started with lab

---

## Midterm

- Midterm due tomorrow, Friday 2/17, at 11:59 p.m.

- Late work not accepted for midterms

- Can answer clarifying questions only after lab

---

## Lab 05: Simpson's Paradox

- The paradox occurs when summary statistics appear to disagree with what is occuring at more fine-grained levels in the data

- Particularly misleading in social scientific and medical contexts

---

### Example

---

### Example Continued

Is it possible that treatment A is the better treatment?

---

### Uneven Grouping

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/05/breakdown.png")
```

---

### Frequencies by Groups

## Lab 05

Do cigarettes improve life expectancy in Britain?

## Getting started with lab

Start new project and set up git:

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the lab-05 repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and hit OK.

- Follow the instructions to configure your git credentials. To double check, run the following 
commands and make sure your info is correct:

```
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```
- Install the `tidyverse` package and make sure it's being loaded in your Lab .Rmd.
