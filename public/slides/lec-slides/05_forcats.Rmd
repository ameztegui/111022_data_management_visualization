# What are factors?

- Factors are  a special case of categorical variables

--

- They have a fixed and known set of possible values. 

--

- Factors have some nice properties that make it easier to work with than characters. As a result, many of the functions in base R automatically convert characters to factors.

# Factors vs. character strings

Let's create a vector of month values:

```{r}

months_string <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")

```

--

Using a string to record this variable has two problems:

--

- The character string doesn’t sort in a useful way (it does in alphabetical order):

```{r}
sort(months_string)
```

--

- There are only 12 possible months, but there’s nothing saving you from typos:

```{r}
bad_spell <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jam", "Mar")
bad_spell
```

# Creating factors

To create a factor you must provide a list of the valid levels:

```{r}
month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
```

--

Now you can create the factor, indicating which levels will be allowed:

```{r}
months_factor <- factor(months_string, levels = month_levels)
months_factor
```


---

# Creating factors

Now, if we sort the values:

```{r}
sort(months_factor)
```

--

And any values not in the set (or mistakes) will be converted to `NA`:

```{r}
factor(bad_spell, levels = month_levels)
```

--

If you omit the levels, they’ll be taken from the data in alphabetical order:

```{r}
factor(c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))

```

---

# Create factors from numeric variables

Sometimes we want to group a numeric/continuous variable into a small subset of categories, i.e., intervals. 
`ggplot()` has three functions to do so:

- `cut_number()` makes n groups with (approximately) equal numbers of observations 
- `cut_width()` makes groups of fixed width
- `cut_interval()` is the most flexible. Allows to makes n groups with equal range or groups of a given width

--

```{r}
numeric_var <- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 50, sd = 15) # 50 random values with mean 50 and sd 15.
hist(numeric_var)
```


---
# Create factors from numeric variables
## `cut_number()`

```{r}
cut_number(numeric_var, n = 5)
```


---

# Create factors from numeric variables
## `cut_width()`

```{r}
cut_width(numeric_var, width = 15)
```

---
# Create factors from numeric variables
## `cut_interval()`

```{r}
cut_interval(numeric_var, n = 4)
```

---
# Create factors from numeric variables
## `cut_interval()`

```{r}
cut_interval(numeric_var, length = 15)
```

---
# Create factors from numeric variables

We can to define the names that we will give to the newly created factor by specifying the `labels = ` argument.

```{r}
cut_interval(numeric_var, n = 4, labels = c("Small", "Medium", "Big", "Bigger"))
```

# Modify factor order

It’s often useful to change the order of the factor levels in a visualisation, for example. There are three main functions: 

1. `fct_inorder()` to put them in order of appearance
2. `fct_reorder()` to change the order based on a variable
3. `fct_infreq()` to sort the values in frequence order

---

# Modify factor order
## `fct_inorder()` 
It sorts the values in appearance order:

```{r}
  
   fct_inorder(months_string)

```

---

# Modify factor order
## `fct_reorder()`

For example, imagine you want to explore the mean height of tree species in Lleida:

```{r}
# Calculate mean height
mean_height <- trees %>%
    filter(Provincia == "25") %>%
    group_by(Especie) %>%
    summarise(height = mean(HeiIf3, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot mean height
ggplot(mean_height, aes(height, Especie)) + 
    geom_point() 
```

---

# Modify factor order
## `fct_reorder()`

`fct_reorder()` changes the values of a factor based on a 2nd variable (numeric). It takes three arguments:

- `f`, the factor whose levels you want to modify.
- `x`, a numeric vector that you want to use to reorder the levels.
- Optionally, `fun`, a function that’s used if there are multiple values of `x` for each value of `f`. The default value is median.

---
# Modify factor order
## `fct_reorder()`

```{r}

mean_height %>%
    mutate(Especie2 = fct_reorder(Especie, height)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(height, Especie2)) +
    geom_point()
```

---
# Modify factor order
## `fct_reorder()`

But we may also want to know the mean number of tree species acrosss diameter classes, for example:

```{r, echo = F}
species_by_CD <- trees %>%
    mutate(CD_class = as.factor(CD)) %>%            # we must convert it using as.factor()
    group_by(CD_class) %>%                          # then, for each CD_class
    summarise(n_species = n_distinct(Especie)) %>%  # we calculate the number of species
    mutate(CD_class2 = fct_reorder(CD_class, n_species))

ggplot(species_by_CD) +
    geom_point(aes(CD_class2, n_species))

```

---

# Modify factor order
## `fct_infreq()`

this is the simplest type of reordering because it doesn’t need any extra variables. It sorts values in increasing frequency: 

.pull-left[
```{r}
# Without ordering
trees %>%
    filter(Provincia == "25") %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(Especie))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}

# In decreasing order
trees %>%
    filter(Provincia == "25") %>%
    mutate(Especie = fct_infreq(Especie)) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(Especie))
```
]

# Modifying factor levels

- `fct_recode()`: to change the values of a factor by hand.

- `fct_collapse()`: to assign a vector of old values to a new value

- `fct_lump()`: to collapse the least/most frequent values of a factor into “other”.

---
# Modifying factor levels
## `fct_recode()`

```{r}
trees %>% 
    mutate(Prov_name = fct_recode(
        Provincia,
        "Barcelona"  = "08",
        "Girona" = "17",
        "Lleida" = "25",
        "Tarragona" = "43")) %>%
    count(Prov_name)

```

---
# Modifying factor levels
## `fct_collapse()`

If you want to collapse a lot of levels, `fct_collapse()` is a useful variant of `fct_recode()`. For each new variable, you can provide a vector of old levels. 

```{r}
trees %>%
  mutate(Pinus_Quercus = fct_collapse(
      Especie,
      Pinus =   c("021", "022", "023", "024", "025", "026", "027", "028", "029"),
      Quercus = c("041", "042", "043", "044", "045", "046", "047", "048", "049"),
      other_level = "Other_sps")) %>%      
    count(Pinus_Quercus) 
```

---
# Modifying factor levels
## `fct_lump()`

Lump together all the small groups to make a plot or table simpler. There are two main variants of `fct_lump()`:


* `fct_lump_min()`: lumps levels that appear fewer than `min` times:

```{r}
trees %>% 
    mutate(Main_sps = fct_lump_min(Especie, 10000))%>%
    count(Main_sps)
```

---
# Modifying factor levels
## `fct_lump()`

* `fct_lump_n()`: lumps all levels except for the `n` most frequent:

```{r}
trees %>%
  mutate(Main_sps = fct_lump_n(Especie, 8)) %>%
  count(Main_sps)
```
