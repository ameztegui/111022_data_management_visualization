# Merge conflicts

---

## Merge conflicts

- When two collaborators make changes to a file and push the file to their repo, git merges these two files.

- If these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a **merge conflict**.

---

## Getting started

- Clone your assignment repo in RStudio Cloud (`hw-01-dataviz-teamname`), and open the .Rmd file.

- Assign the numbers 1, 2, 3 (and 4, if you have 4 members) to each of the team members.

---

## Let's cause a merge conflict

Take turns in completing the exercise, only one member at a time. For now, only commit and push the Rmd file:

- Member 1 - Change the team name to your actual team name, knit, commit, push.

- Member 2 - Change the team name to some other word, knit, commit, push. You should get an error. Pull. Take a look at the document with the merge conflict. Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change. Commit, and push.

- Member 3 - Add a name to the first code chunk, knit, commit, push. You should get an error. Pull. No merge conflicts should occur. Now push.

- Member 4 - Add a different name to the first code chunk, knit, commit, push. You should get an error. Pull. Take a look at the document with the merge conflict. Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change. Commit, and push.

- All members - Pull, and observe the changes in your document.

---

## Tips for collaborating via git/GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.

- Commit, and push, often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.

- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions asap, don't let it linger and get bigger.
