# Characterizing relationships with models

---

## Data &amp; packages


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```


```r
pp &lt;- read_csv("data/paris_paintings.csv", 
               na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))
```

---

## Want to follow along?

Go to RStudio Cloud -&gt; make a copy of "Modelling Paris Paintings"

---

## Height &amp; width


```r
(m_ht_wt &lt;- lm(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp))
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)     Width_in  
##      3.6214       0.7808
```

--

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\widehat{Height_{in}} = 3.62 + 0.78~Width_{in}$$`

--

- **Slope:** For each additional inch the painting is wider, the height is expected
to be higher, on average, by 0.78 inches.

--

- **Intercept:** Paintings that are 0 inches wide are expected to be 3.62 inches high,
on average.
    - Does this make sense?

---

## The linear model with a single predictor

- We're interested in the `\(\beta_0\)` (population parameter for the intercept)
and the `\(\beta_1\)` (population parameter for the slope) in the 
following model:

$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x $$

--

- Tough luck, you can't have them...

--

- So we use the sample statistics to estimate them:

$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1~x $$

---

## Least squares regression

The regression line minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

--

If `\(e_i = y - \hat{y}\)`,

then, the regression line minimizes `\(\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i^2\)`.

---

## Properties of the least squares regression line

- The regression line goes through the center of mass point, the coordinates corresponding to average `\(x\)` and average `\(y\)`: `\((\bar{x}, \bar{y})\)`:

`$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x ~ \rightarrow ~ b_0 = \hat{y} - b_1 x$$`

- The slope has the same sign as the correlation coefficient:

`$$b_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$$`

- The sum of the residuals is zero: 
`$$\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i = 0$$`

- The residuals and `\(x\)` values are uncorrelated.

---

## Height &amp; landscape features


```r
(m_ht_lands &lt;- lm(Height_in ~ factor(landsALL), data = pp))
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = Height_in ~ factor(landsALL), data = pp)
## 
## Coefficients:
##       (Intercept)  factor(landsALL)1  
##            22.680             -5.645
```

--

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\widehat{Height_{in}} = 22.68 - 5.65~landsALL$$`

---

## Height &amp; landscape features (cont.)

- **Slope:** Paintings with landscape features are expected, on average,
to be 5.65 inches shorter than paintings that without landscape features.
    - Compares baseline level (`landsALL = 0`) to other level
    (`landsALL = 1`).

- **Intercept:** Paintings that don't have landscape features are expected, on 
average, to be 22.68 inches tall.

## Relationship between height and school


```r
(m_ht_sch &lt;- lm(Height_in ~ school_pntg, data = pp))
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = Height_in ~ school_pntg, data = pp)
## 
## Coefficients:
##     (Intercept)  school_pntgD/FL     school_pntgF     school_pntgG  
##          14.000            2.329           10.197            1.650  
##    school_pntgI     school_pntgS     school_pntgX  
##          10.287           30.429            2.869
```

--

- When the categorical explanatory variable has many levels, they're encoded to
**dummy variables**.

- Each coefficient describes the expected difference between heights in that 
particular school compared to the baseline level.

## The linear model with multiple predictors

- Population model:

$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x_1 + \beta_2~x_2 + \cdots + \beta_k~x_k $$

--

- Sample model that we use to estimate the population model:
  
$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1~x_1 + b_2~x_2 + \cdots + b_k~x_k $$

# Prediction with models

## Predict height from width

.question[
On average, how tall are paintings that are 60 inches wide?
`$$\widehat{Height_{in}} = 3.62 + 0.78~Width_{in}$$`
]

--


```r
3.62 + 0.78 * 60
```

```
## [1] 50.42
```

"On average, we expect paintings that are 60 inches wide to be 50.42 inches high."

**Warning:** We "expect" this to happen, but there will be some variability. (We'll
learn about measuring the variability around the prediction later.)

---

## Prediction vs. extrapolation

.question[
On average, how tall are paintings that are 400 inches wide?
`$$\widehat{Height_{in}} = 3.62 + 0.78~Width_{in}$$`
]

## Watch out for extrapolation!

&gt; "When those blizzards hit the East Coast this winter, it proved to my satisfaction 
that global warming was a fraud. That snow was freezing cold. But in an alarming 
trend, temperatures this spring have risen. Consider this: On February 6th it was 10 
degrees. Today it hit almost 80. At this rate, by August it will be 220 degrees. So 
clearly folks the climate debate rages on."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;br&gt;

# Measuring model fit

---

## Measuring the strength of the fit

- The strength of the fit of a linear model is most commonly evaluated using `\(R^2\)`.

- It tells us what percent of variability in the response variable is explained by 
the model.

- The remainder of the variability is explained by variables not included in the 
model.

- `\(R^2\)` is sometimes called the coefficient of determination.

---

## Obtaining `\(R^2\)` in R

- Height vs. width

```r

```
## [1] 0.6829468

Roughly 68% of the variability in heights of paintings can be explained by their
widths.
