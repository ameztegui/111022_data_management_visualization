# When to use functions?

Whenever we find ourselves copypasting more than 3 times:

```{r, eval = F}
lleida_trees %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by(Codi) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))

barcelona_trees %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by(Codi) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))

girona_trees %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by(Codi) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))
```

# Advantages of using functions

#### 1. You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste 

--

#### 2. As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, not all over your script
--

#### 3. An evocative function name can make your code easier to understand.

# Functional sequences

We can save piped sequences of operations as pseudo-functions:

```{r, eval = F}
lleida_trees %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by(Codi) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))
```

---

# Functional sequences

We can save piped sequences of operations as pseudo-functions:

```{r}
 mean_plot_growth <- . %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by(Codi) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))
```

--

```{r}
mean_plot_growth
```

---

# Functional sequences

So we can now apply the pseudofunctions to any dataframe:

```{r}
mean_plot_growth(lleida_trees)
```

# Functions

A true R function should work in any environment, not only with piped operations. 
There are three key steps to creating a new function:

--

1. You need to pick a **name** for the function. Try to make it simple, but auto-explicative (it's an art)

--

2. You **list the inputs, or arguments**, to the function inside function. If we had several arguments, the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.

--

3. You place the code you have developed in the body of the function, within a `{` block that immediately follows `function(...)`.

--

So a function typically has the following look:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

my_function <- function (argument1, argument2) {
    operation1
    operation2
    output
}
```

---

# Functions

Imagine, for example, that we want to rescale a given variable `x` between 0 and 1:

--

```{r}
rescale <- function (x) {
    (x - min(x, na.rm = T)) / (max(x, na.rm = T) - min(x, na.rm = T))
}
```

---

# Functions
This function can then be applied to any numerical variable in the same way as any other built-in function (`mean`, `max`, etc.):


```{r}
x <- rnorm(50, 10, 5)
rescale(x)
```

---

# Functions
or can be applied within code chunks in the same way as any other built-in function:

```{r}
trees %>% 
    mutate_at(.vars=c("DiamIf2", "DiamIf3"),
              .funs = rescale) 
```


---

# Create functions

For more complex functions, it is useful to think which are the inputs. For example, in the case of the pseudo-function we created before:

```{r}
 mean_plot_growth <- . %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by(Codi) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))
```

--
...so we could create this function...
```{r}
 mean_plot_growth <- function (df) {
    df %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by(Codi) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))
 }
```
---

# Create functions

```{r}
mean_plot_growth(lleida_trees)
```

What if we want to generalize a bit more the function for average growth? For example, if we want let the user  define if they want the mean growth per plot, per species...

```{r}
 mean_plot_growth <- function (df, grouping_var) {
    df %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by(grouping_var) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))
}
```

---

# Tidy eval: Programming in the tidyverse

And now we could do:

```{r, error = T}
mean_plot_growth(lleida_trees, Especie)

```

--

### What's happening?

--

* Most dplyr functions use non-standard evaluation (NSE). That means they donâ€™t follow the usual R rules of evaluation
--

* As a consequence, dplyr will first look for the column `grouping_var` in the dataframe. 
--

* If we want to use a `dplyr` verb within a function, we must operate a bit differently.

# Tidy eval: Programming in the tidyverse

In this case, with the `{{` operator, we can tunnel data-variables (i.e. columns from the data frames) through arg-variables (function arguments):

```{r}
 mean_plot_growth2 <- function (df, grouping_var) {
    df %>%
    mutate(growth = DiamIf3- DiamIf2) %>%
    group_by({{grouping_var}}) %>%
    summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth, na.rm = T))
 }
```

# Tidy eval: Programming in the tidyverse

`{{}}` makes it possible to supply variables from the data frame to your wrapper function:

```{r}
mean_plot_growth2(lleida_trees, Especie)
```

---

# Tidy eval: Programming in the tidyverse

`{{}}` makes it possible to supply variables from the data frame to your wrapper function:
```{r}
mean_plot_growth2(lleida_trees, Codi)

```

---

# Tidy eval: Programming in the tidyverse

`{{}}` makes it possible to supply variables from the data frame to your wrapper function:
```{r}
mean_plot_growth2(lleida_trees, CD)
```
