## Study results

```{r message=FALSE}
mb_yawn <- read_csv("data/mb-yawn.csv")
```

.small[
```{r}
mb_yawn %>%
  count(group, outcome) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```
]

Difference in proportions of yawners: 

$\hat{p}_{treatment} - \hat{p}_{control} = 0.2941 - 0.25 = 0.0441$

---

## Two competing claims

- "There is nothing going on." 
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **independent**, yawning is not contagious, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. $\rightarrow$ Null hypothesis

- "There is something going on."
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **dependent**, yawning is contagious, observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. $\rightarrow$ Alternative hypothesis

---

## Running the simulation

1. Shuffle the 50 cards at least 7 times<sup>1</sup> to ensure that the cards counted out are from a random process.

2. Count out the top 16 cards and set them aside. These cards represent the people in the control group.

3. Out of the remaining 34 cards (treatment group) count the \red{number of face cards} (the number of people who yawned in the treatment group).

4. Calculate the difference in proportions of yawners (treatment - control), and plot it 
on the board.

5. Mark the difference you find on the dot plot on the board.

## Simulation by hand

.question[
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` Do the simulation results suggest that yawning 
is contagious, i.e. does seeing someone yawn and yawning appear to be dependent?

null distribution to be?
]

ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) +
  labs(title = "Null distribution")
```

---

## Calculating the p-value, visually

.question[
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` What is the p-value, i.e. in what % of the 
simulations was the simulated difference in sample proportion at least as extreme 
as the observed difference in sample proportions?
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) +
  labs(title = "Null distribution")
```

## Calculating the p-value, directly

## What do you want to do?

- Estimation -> Confidence interval

- Decision -> Hypothesis test

- First step: Ask the following questions

  1. How many variables?
  2. What types of variables?
  3. What is the research question?

# Confidence intervals

---

## Confidence intervals

- Bootstrap

- Bounds: cutoff values for the middle XX% of the distribution

- Interpretation: We are XX% confident that the true population parameter is in the interval.

- Definition of confidence level: XX% of random samples of size n are expected to produce confidence intervals that contain the true population parameter.

- `infer::generate(reps, type = "bootstrap")`

.small[
.question[
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` Describe the simulation process for estimating the parameter assigned to your team.

- Note any assumptions you make in terms of sample size, observed sample statistic, etc.

## Accuracy vs. precision

.question[
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` What happens to the width of the confidence interval as the confidence level increases? Why? Should we always prefer a confidence interval with a higher confidence level?

acs_10 <- acs_emp %>% sample_n(10) %>%
  specify(response = income) %>%
  generate(1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "median")
acs_100 <- acs_emp %>% sample_n(100) %>%
  specify(response = income) %>%
  generate(1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%

acs_500 <- acs_emp %>% sample_n(500) %>%
  specify(response = income) %>%
  generate(1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%

## Hypothesis testing

- Calculate the observed sample statistic.

- Calculate the p-value.

- Make a conclusion, about the hypotheses, in context of the data and the research question.

## Testing errors

- Type 1: Reject $H_0$ when you shouldn't have
    + P(Type 1 error) = $\alpha$
    
- Type 2: Fail to reject $H_0$ when you should have
    + P(Type 2 error) is harder to calculate, but increases as $\alpha$ decreases
