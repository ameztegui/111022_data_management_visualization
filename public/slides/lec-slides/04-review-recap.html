# R/RStudio

---

# R/RStudio

- R: statistical programming language

- RStudio: integrated development environment for the R language

- RStudio Cloud allows us to use RStudio without local installation (which can be hairy)
  - Interested in learning about other ways of using RStudio -- come by office hours
  - Already have another way of using RStudio -- make sure to maintain Cloud account for quick classroom execises
  
---

# R packages

- R is an open source language

- Packages developed by open source developers

# Git/GitHub

## Merge conflicts

.pull-left[
Confused about merge conflicts? Everyone is...
]
.pull-right[
![](img/04/so-git-merge.png)
]

--

- Why does a merge conflict happen?

--

- TELL ME YOUR WOES...

---

## Caching your password

Needs to be done on a per-project basis (for now):

- Go to the Terminal within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for `\(60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800\)` seconds


```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

---

## Tips for collaborating via Git/GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.

- Commit, and push, often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.

- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions asap, don't let it linger and get bigger.

# Visualizing Star Wars (better)

Follow along on ‚òÅÔ∏è: Review and recap - 02-07 -- `viz-star-wars.Rmd`

---

## Starting point


```r
library(tidyverse)
starwars &lt;- starwars %&gt;%
  filter(mass &lt; 500)

ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Add title


```r
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Star Wars characters")
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Add x and y labels


```r
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Star Wars characters",
       x = "Height (in cm)", y = "Mass (in kg)")
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Change legend label


```r
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Star Wars characters",
       x = "Height (in cm)", y = "Mass (in kg)", color = "Gender")
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Change zooming


```r
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Star Wars characters",
       x = "Height (in cm)", y = "Mass (in kg)", color = "Gender") +
  xlim(c(100, 200)) + 
  ylim(c(40, 120))
```

```
## Warning: Removed 14 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Change transparency


```r
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Star Wars characters",
       x = "Height (in cm)", y = "Mass (in kg)", color = "Gender")
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Change theme - `theme_dark()`


```r
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Star Wars characters",
       x = "Height (in cm)", y = "Mass (in kg)", color = "Gender") +
  theme_dark()
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Change theme - `theme_minimal()`


```r
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Star Wars characters",
       x = "Height (in cm)", y = "Mass (in kg)", color = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## 538 theme


```r
# install.packages("ggthemes")
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Star Wars characters",
       x = "Height (in cm)", y = "Mass (in kg)", color = "Gender") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

![](04-review-recap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Further customization

- It is possible to do a lot more customization to your plots
- See http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/ for help on using the ggplot2 package
    + You can find a list of all ggplot2 functions in the Reference tab of the package homepage
- You'll find that sometimes customization is valuable, and sometimes the defaults work well and while customization might be doable (technically) it might not be necessary

# Activity

Follow along on ‚òÅÔ∏è: Review and recap - 02-07 -- `examine-world-trend.Rmd`

---

## Examining world trends

Examine the code given to produce the existing plots in the "Examining Gapminder data" document. Then, make the appropriate changes listed below. 

- Task 1: Subset for 1952 (instead of 2007)
- Task 2: Plot life expectancy (`lifeExp`) vs. population (`pop`)
- Task 3: In addition to coloring the points by continent, size the points by GPD (`gpdPercap`)
- Task 4: A brief (1-2 sentences only) description of what you see in the plot.

Work on it individually, but consult with your teammates alogn the way.

# Wrangling diamonds üíç

Follow along on ‚òÅÔ∏è: Review and recap - 02-07 -- `wrangling-diamonds.Rmd`

---

## The data

Diamond prices are driven by 4Cs: carat, cut, color, and clarity. We'll explore a dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamondsn from the tidyverse package.

Take a peek at the codebook with


```r
?diamonds
```

or at http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html.

---

## 4Cs

- Carat: unit of mass equal to 200 mg used for measuring gemstones and pearls 

- Cut: objective measure of a diamond's light performance / sparkle

- Color:

![diamond_colors](img/04/diamond_colors.png)

- Clarity:

![diamond_clarity](img/04/diamond_clarity.png)

---

## Measurements

![diamond_measurements](img/04/diamond_measurements.png)

---

## Price

What type of variable is price? Would you expect its distribution to be symmetric, right-skewed, or left-skewed? Why? Make a histogram of the distribution of diamond prices. Does the shape of the distribution match your expectation?



---

## Cut

How many diamonds of each type of cut are there?



---

## Clarity

Calculate the relative frequency of each clarity of diamonds.



---

## Clarity by cut

Calculate the relative frequency of each clarity of diamonds by cut.



---

## Depth and price

Plot the relationship between depth and price of only fair cut diamonds.




---

## Cut and price

For each type of cut, calculate minimum (`min`), maximum (`max`), mean (`mean`), and median (`median`) price of diamonds of that type.



---

## Recap

- Start with data frame
- Pipe into a verb
- Only print output if counting, summarizing, etc.
- Save output as the original data frame (or something else) if more will be done with the data frame in another step/pipe
