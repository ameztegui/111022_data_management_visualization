# The tidyverse

The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science, as a suite aimed
at easening the data analysis in all its steps.

Created by Hadley Wickham, chief scientist of RStudio, and author of more than
30 R packages (`readr`, `ggplot2`, `plyr`, `devtools`, `roxygen2`, `rmarkdown`...)

All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

.pull-extleft[![](resources/images/hex-tidyverse.png)]

.pull-extleft_right[

* `ggplot2` a system for creating graphics, based on the Grammar of Graphics

* `readr` a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (csv, txt...)

* `tibble` a tibble is a re-imagining version of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective and throwing out what has not

* `stringr` provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible

* `forcats` provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors

* `dplyr` provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges
 
* `tidyr` provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data
 
* `purrr` enhances R’s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors

# Installation and use


 - Install all the packages in the tidyverse by running `install.packages("tidyverse")`

 - Run `library(tidyverse)` to load the core tidyverse and make it available in your current R session.
 - Learn more about the tidyverse package at http://tidyverse.tidyverse.org.
 - Or check the cheatsheets
 
 ![](resources/images/cheatsheet_purrr.png)

---

# Before we start...

- Neither `tidyr`, nor `dplyr` or `purrr` do anything that can't be done with
  base R code, `apply` family functions, `for` loops or other packages.  

- Designed to be more efficient (in time), easier to read and easier to use. More intuitive to use, specially for beginners (it may require some adaptation if you are used to base R code).

- Valid mostly for data.frames. For other formats (matrices, arrays) `plyr` can
  be used.

# Our data

  1. `plots [11858 x 15]`: all plots from the Third Spanish Forest Inventory (IFN3) in Catalonia  

  2. `trees [111756 x 12]`: all trees with dbh > 7.5 cm measured in both
     IFN2 and IFN3  

  3. `species [14778 x 15]`: number of trees per hectare in each plot, by
     species and size class  

  4. `coordinates [11858 x 6]`: X and Y UTM coordinates of each plot.  

  5. `leaf [10447 x 3]`: leaf biomass and carbon content for those IFN 3 plots where they
    were available

# 5 main verbs of dplyr

  - `filter`: keep the rows that match a condition
  
  - `select`: keep columns by name
  
  - `arrange`: sort rows
  
  - `mutate`: transform existent variables or create new ones
  
  - `summarise`: do some summary statistics and reduce data

---

# common structure

## (for most of the tidyverse)

```r
verb(data, ...)
```

- first argument: data (as data.frame or tbl_df)
- the rest of arguments specify what to do with the data frame
- output is always another data frame (tbl_df or data.frame)
- unless we are assigning (`<-`), never modifies the original data frame

  4.2 Create two new variables with basal area of each tree (in $m^2$ per hectare), both for IFN2 and
      IFN3. Which is the species of the fastest-growing tree in basal area?

# Reducing variables (`summarise`)

## Exercise 5

Which statistics would you calculate to characterize diameter values in each plot?

---
class: code60

# Targeted transformations

## `summarise_if` and `summarise_at`

We can apply a summarising function to a group of variables...  

  - that share some commmon characteristic that can be tested (i.e. numeric variables)

```{r summarise_if}
summarise_if(trees, is.numeric, mean)
```

  - by name or using the select helpers (`starts_with`, `ends_with`, `one_of`)

```{r summarise_at}
summarise_at(trees, vars(starts_with('Diam')), mean)
```

---
class: code60

# Targeted transformations

## `mutate_if` and `mutate_at`

The same can be done with `mutate`:

.pull-left[
```{r mutate_if}
mutate_if(trees, is.numeric, log)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r mutate_at}
mutate_at(
  trees, vars(one_of(c('Especie', 'Species'))),
  ~ paste0('sp_', .x)
)

# Data pipelines (`%>%`)

  - Often, we want to use several verbs (filter, arrange, group_by, summarise...)

  - Multiple operations are difficult to read, or require to create multiple intermediate
    objects:

.pull-left[

```{r bad_left, eval = FALSE}
diam_especie <- filter(
  summarise(
    group_by(
      filter(
        trees, !is.na(DiamIf3)
      ),
      Codi, Especie
    ),
    diam = mean(DiamIf3),
    n = n()
  ),
  n > 5
)
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r bad_right, eval = FALSE}
no_na_trees <- filter(
  trees, !is.na(DiamIf3)
)
no_na_trees_grouped <- group_by(
  no_na_trees, Codi, Especie
)
summarised_no_na_trees <- summarise(
  no_na_trees_grouped,
  diam = mean(DiamIf3), n = n()
)
final_data <- filter(
  summarised_no_na_trees, n > 5
)
```

]

---

# Data pipelines (`%>%`)

  - Alternative (cleaner and easy to read): *pipe* operator (`%>%`) from `magrittr` package
  
  - The result of the left side is passed to the function in the right as first argument:
  
  `f(x, y)` is the same as `x %>% f(y)`  
  `f(x, y, z)` is the same as `x %>% f(y, z)`

  - In the tidyverse `%>%` makes each function to be applied to the data frame resulting
    from the previous step
  
  `filter(df, color == 'blue')` is the same as `df %>% filter(color == 'blue')`  
  `mutate(df, double = 2*value)` is the same as `df %>% mutate(double = 2*value)`

---

      ),
      Codi, Especie

    diam = mean(DiamIf3),

    n = n()
  ) %>%
  filter(n > 5)
```

]

# Data pipelines (`%>%`)

## Exercise 6

Create pipelines to answer the following questions:

  6.1 Which **plots** have the fastest average growth rate?
  
  6.2 Which is the plot with the **most species**?
  
  6.3 Is there any **relationship** between both variables? <br>

output):

```r

```

Sometimes, however, we may be interested in calculating new variables by group, but without
reducing the dimensions:

# Grouped `mutate`/`filter`

## Exercise 7

  7.1 Identify those trees that grow most as compared to the average in that plot <br>
  .font80[(Hint: calculate growth, *then* mean growth by plot, and *then* the difference)]
  
  7.2 Identify those plots where a species grows much more than the average for the species
</br>
</br>
**Extra (in case you get bored):**  

  7.3 Select IFN plots with pure *Pinus nigra* stands (Especie =
      025). Note: we consider a forest to be monospecific when > 80% in BA corresponds to
      a single species

---

# purrr

Allows to do functional programming with R, making loops and repetitive tasks
pipe-friendly and easier to read.

```{r purrr_ex}
c(1, 2, 3) %>%
  map_dbl(~ .*2)

c('a', 'b', 'c') %>%

---

# purrr

## common structure

```r

```

- first argument: vector or list (included data frames)
- second argument: function to apply to each element of .x
- output is always a vector or a list of the same length as .x

---

# purrr

## The verbs of purrr

  - `map`: Tranforms the input by applying a function to each element and returning a
    vector the same length as the input
    
  - `walk`: The same as `map`, but only for the side-effect, returning the original input
  
---

# map

## Flavours

  - `map`: Returns always a list
  - `map_chr`, `map_dbl`, `map_int`, `map_lgl`: Returns a vector of the corresponding type
  - `map_dfr`, `map_dfc`: Returns a data frame created by row- or column-binding

---

# map

## functions

Functions to apply to each element can be supplied in different forms:

  - lambda function: starting with `~` and with `.` as the element placeholder

```{r, eval=FALSE}
list.files('data', '.csv', full.names = TRUE) %>%
  map_dfr(~ read_csv(., col_types = 'ccccc???????'))
```

  - function name: if it needs extra arguments, can be supplied after the function name

```{r, eval=FALSE}
list.files('data', '.csv', full.names = TRUE) %>%
  map_dfr(read_csv, col_types = 'ccccc???????')
```

---

# map

## Models workflow become easier

# walk

## Side-effects

Sometimes we want to perform a pipe step only for its side-effect (printing, plotting...)
but continue with the pipe afterwards. We could write an intermediate step or we can use
walk

```{r}
list.files('data', '.csv', full.names = TRUE) %>%
  walk(print) %>%
  map_dfr(read_csv, col_types = 'ccccc???????')
```

## Exercise 11

In this exercise we will use some of the knowledge acquired in this workshop

  11.1 Lets see if there is a relationship between leaf biomass (in the `leaf` dataset)
    and tree height (in the `trees` dataset), for each province at the plot level. For that
    you will need to summarise tree values, join with the leaf data, split by provinces and
    perform the model for each province.
