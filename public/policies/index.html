	            <h3 id="class">Class:</h3>

<p>Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. As instructors, we are here to introduce you the concepts, tools and techniques, and to assist you through your learning process, but it is up to you to make use of them. Programming is a skill that is best learned by doing, so as much as possible you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class.
The classes will be held in a computer room, but if you prefer, you can bring your own laptop to class, fully charged. Please <strong>refrain from texting</strong> or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class.</p>

<h3 id="course-components">Course components:</h3>

<h4 id="lectures"><strong>Lectures</strong></h4>

<p>Usually, every session will start with a (hopefully short) lecture in which we set up the goals and expectations for the session, and introduce the tools we will use. Then, depending on the class format, the content may vary.</p>

<h4 id="labs"><strong>Labs</strong></h4>

<p>The objective of the labs is to give you hands-on experience with data analysis using modern statistical software. The labs will also provide you with tools that you will need to complete the final project successfully. Some of the labs will be provided for you to complete them at home, and other will be like workshops that we will complete in class.</p>

<p>If so, we will start the labs together, but they are self paced tutorials with examples, so from a point you will work on your own (although you are free, and even encouraged, to discuss with your teammates or ask us any question).</p>

<p>The labs will include some short exercises you will need to complete, by creating a &quot;lab report&quot; (we'll see how). You are not forced to finish the lab in class, you can finish it later at home, but we expect you to have finished it before the next class session.</p>

<h4 id="readings"><strong>Readings</strong></h4>

<p>During the course we will recommend some external readings to expand or consolidate concepts seen in class. These are usually not mandatory, but highly recommended, and we may discuss the contents during the classes.</p>

<h4 id="homework"><strong>Homework</strong></h4>

<p>Beyond the in class activities, you will be assigned some larger data analysis tasks throughout the semester. These assignments will be completed individually, and we will set the deadlines as the course progresses.</p>

<h4 id="exams"><strong>Exams</strong></h4>

<p>There will be two midterms that you will need to complete individually. Each exam will ask you to complete a number of small programming and or analysis tasks related to the material presented in the class. The exact structure and content of the exams will be discussed in more detail before they are assigned.</p>

<h4 id="final-project"><strong>Final Project:</strong></h4>

<p>You will be responsible for the completion of an open ended final project for this course, the goal of which is to tackle an &quot;interesting&quot; problem using the tools and techniques covered in this class. You are supposed to use your own dataset (ideally it will come from your master's thesis), but we can provide you with some data if needed. At the end of the semester, you must present the results (and the code you used to get them) to your classmates. Additional details on the project will be provided as the course progresses.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading:</h3>

<p>Your final grade will be comprised of the following:</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped text-left">
<thead>
<tr>
<th><span></span></th>
<th><span></span></th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Labs</td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Homework</td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Midterm 1</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Midterm 2</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Final project</td>
<td>40%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Participation &amp; Peer evaluation</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Class attendance in lectures and labs is not mandatory, but is a firm expectation; frequent absences or tardiness will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction.</p>

<p>Excused absences do not excuse you from assigned homework, it is your responsibility to make alternative arrangements to turn in any assignments in a timely fashion.</p>

<h3 id="late--missed-work-policy">Late / missed work policy</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Late work policy for homework assignments:</p>

<ul>
<li>late, but within 48 hours of due date/time: -20%</li>
<li>any later: no credit
<br></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Late work will not be accepted for the final project.</p></li>

<li><p>You must complete the final project and be in class to present it in order to pass this course.</p></li>

<li><p>Please talk to us in case of illness, or personal or family issues that interferes with your ability to attend or complete classes.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity:</h3>

<p>We expect each of you to behave in accordance to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability that characterize the University community.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Please <strong>refrain from texting</strong> or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class.</p></li>

<li><p>Use of disallowed materials during the exams will not be tolerated.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A note on sharing / reusing code:</strong> We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless we explicitly tell you not to use something, the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration), and that is not coming from the materials we provide. Except for the exams, you are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not directly send or make use of code from another student in this class. On the  exams all communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.</p>

<h3 id="diversity--inclusiveness">Diversity &amp; Inclusiveness:</h3>

<p>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official University records, please let us know!</p></li>

<li><p>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with any of us. If you prefer to speak with someone outside the course, the MSc Coordinator is an excellent resource.</p></li>

<li><p>We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-get-help">How to get help:</h3>

<p>One of the best things about R is its community. Some highly recommended resources are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R bloggers</a>: A website dedicated to R development of tutorials.</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>: Website devoted to questions-and-answers on programming languages among which is R also available.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/search?q=&amp;facets%5Btechnology%5D%5B%5D=R">Datacamp</a>: Interactive data science tutorials covering many topics. Some are paid.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/">RStudio Online Learning</a>: A wealth of tutorials, articles, and examples developed by RStudio to help you learn R and its extensions.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.r-tutor.com/">R-Tutor</a>: A website devoted to teach statistics. An useful one if you are not much familiar with basic statistical methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to become familiar from the beginning with the various alternatives for getting help. A key part of your success in using R lies in your ability to be self-relient and be able to get help and apply it to your own problems.</p>

<p>Often it's a lot more pleasant and efficient to get your questions answered in person. Make use of the teaching team's office hours, we're here to help!</p>

<p>For personal and grade related questions, or any issue not considered here, please do not hesitate in contacting us by email.</p>
