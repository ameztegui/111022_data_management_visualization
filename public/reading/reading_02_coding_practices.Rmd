In the slides for this lesson we have already provided several additional resources, here are the most recommended:

- Wilson, G; Bryan, J; et al. (2017) [Good enough practices in scientific computing.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) PLoS Computational Biology 13(6): e1005510. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510
 - Wilson, G; Aruliah, D.A; et al. (2014) [Best practices in scientific computing.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) PLoS Biology 12(1): e1001745. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745 (This is probably too advanced for this course, but is offered as reference)
