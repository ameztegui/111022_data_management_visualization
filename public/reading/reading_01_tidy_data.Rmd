For this unit about the data pipeline and tidy data I highly recommend you to read the following short paper by Hadely Wickham, who created both the concept of tidy data and the tidyverse:

- Wickham, H. (2014) [Tidy data. ](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf) Journal of Statistical Software 59(10)
