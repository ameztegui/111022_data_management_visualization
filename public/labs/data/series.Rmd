It is very difficult to define our favorite series, there are so many good ones! 
It may be easier if we separate into **drama** and **commedies**.

### My favorite drama TV series

1. Breaking bad
2. The West Wing
3. Northern Exposure
4. Game of Thrones

### My favorite TV commedy series

In the case of commedies, I cannot possible rank them, but *among* my favorite commedies I can cite:

- Monty Python Flying Circus
- The Office
    - The Office UK version
    - The Office US version
- Seinfeld
