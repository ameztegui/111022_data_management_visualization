# Lab 04: Wrangling spatial data
### 2018-02-08

## Agenda

1. Lab logistics
2. Review of Lab 03
3. Lab 04: Wrangling spatial data
4. Getting started with lab

---

## Lab logistics

- Start the lab in class:
  - You can read it ahead of time but wait till we do an intro to get everyone on the same page to actually start doing the lab.
  - Make a decision as a team -- if you want to read the lab ahead of time, all team members should do the same.

- Make time to meet outside of class: We recommend that you set a weekly meeting time that all team members can commit to so that you can use that time to finish the lab.

- Actually read the lab:
  - Don't just skip to the exercises.
  - Read and do everything outlined, even if you don't have to turn it in as part of an exercise.
  - If the expectations of an exercise is not clear, ask (and we made some formatting updated to help).

## Review of Lab 03

- Describe the premise of the last lab.

- What did you discover in the last lab, particularly with respect to the joke "La Quinta is Spanish for next to Denny's"?

---

## Lab 04: Wrangling spatial data

- Same data set
- Start by eliminating non-US locations
- Keep the two data frames (Denny's and La Quinta) separate
- Join these data frames in a way that lists all possible pairings of Denny's and La Quinta locations in a given state

- Calculate the distances between the establishments and compare across a few states where Mitch Hedberg's joke seems more likely to hold true

## Getting started with lab

Start new project and set up git:

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the lab-03 repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and hit OK.

- Follow the instructions to configure your git credentials. To double check, run the following 
commands and make sure your info is correct:

```
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```
- Install the `tidyverse` package and make sure it's being loaded in your Lab .Rmd.

- Cache your password (if you like)
