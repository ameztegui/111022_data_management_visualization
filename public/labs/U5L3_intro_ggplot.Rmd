The main goal of this lab is to introduce you to the `ggplot2` R package, and to provide some basic insights on its syntax for plotting. The contents of this *lab* have been adapted/taken from @wickham2009 and @wilke2019fundamentals.


# What's ggplot2? {-}


`ggplot2` is a package belonging to the tidyverse suite that provides a **complete set of tools to visualize tidy data**. As most of the packages of the tidyverse, `ggplot2` is designed to work with **tidy data**, so that it integrats into the data science pipeline. Alongside, it can be integrated within a pipeline, so that it will take as input any output coming from `dplyr` and/or `tidyr`.

`ggplot2` syntax can seem complex at first, with a somewhat steep learning curve. That being said, learning `ggplot2` is worth the effort for a couple of reasons. First, the graphs are beautiful. Second, the solid underlying model of `ggplot2`, based on the Grammar of Graphics [@grammargraphics], makes it easy to produce a wide range of graphics with a compact syntax, since each chart is made up of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. In fact, its carefully chosen defaults mean that you can produce publication-quality graphics in seconds. However, if you do have special formatting requirements, it's comprehensive theming system makes it easy to do what you want. Ultimately, this means that rather than spending your time making your graph look pretty, you can instead focus on creating the graph that best reveal the message in your data. This makes `ggplot2` very powerful because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.

![`ggplot2` provides beautiful, hassle-free plots that take care of fiddly details like drawing legends. ](images/fundamentals_vis/ggplot_examples.png)

# Why use ggplot2? {-}

There are a number of other graphics systems available in R: base graphics, grid graphics and trellis/lattice graphics. So how does `ggplot2` differ from them? Why should we use `ggplot2`? There are many reasons to learn `ggplot`. You will probably learn a few more while progressing through the course but here goes the main ones:

- **Automatic legends, colors schemes, etc.**

- Easy superposition, **facetting**, etc.

- Nice rendering (yet, I don't like the default grey theme).

- **Store any ggplot2 object for modification or future recall.** 

- Lots of users (less bugs, much help on Stack Overflow).

- Lots of [extensions](https://mode.com/blog/r-ggplot-extension-packages) to extend `ggplot`'s functionality.

- Nice saving options into multiple image formats.


# How to use ggplot2 {-}

`ggplot2` is designed to work iteratively. You can start with a layer showing the raw data then add layers of annotations, define color schemes, modify the axes, the legend, or the general aspect of the plot. It allows you to produce graphics using the same structured thinking that you use to design an analysis, reducing the distance between a plot in your head and one on the page..

There are 3 essential elements to any `ggplot()` call:

1. A `data` object including the information we want to represent/deliver/communicate. As `ggplot2` is part of the tidyverse, the dataset parsed to `data` must be in a *tidy format*

2. A `geom` or geometry that tells `ggplot2` about the basic structure of the graph. Intuitively, the geom can be thought of as the type of chart you are graphing (bar plot, scatterplot, histogram...)

3. `aesthetics` that tell `ggplot()` which variables are being mapped onto the *x* axis, the *y* axis, (and often other attributes of the graph, such as the color, line type, etc.). Intuitively, the aesthetic can be thought of as what you are graphing.

In addition to these three components, we can add elements to define the coordinate system, tje scale, the theme, configure the fonts, the legend, graph title, axes, colour palettes... But these are not mandatory, if we don't define them `ggplot2` will assign them default values.


The basic syntax and elements of a ggplot call is thus something close to this:

![Basic requirements to generate a `ggplot`](images/fundamentals_vis/ggplot_basics.png)


> Note that, same to `dplyr`, there is a *linking command* that allows connecting instructions. `ggplot2` uses `+` as a linking command.


## Working through the `ggplot()`layers {-}

As seen above, a graphic is made of different layers, combined together to visually communicate information in our data. Let us build a `ggplot` graphic step by step by adding one layer at a time. `ggplot2` code is easier to read if each line represents a new element. This style is generally favoured for `ggplot2` code in the R community. This means that as you add each layer, you should start a new line.

### Data layer {-}

```{r fig.asp = 3/4, fig.cap = 'Without any other information, your data will not be visualised.',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = fires) 
```

### Aesthetics layer {-}

In `ggplot2`, aesthetics are a group of parameters that specify what and how data is displayed. Here, we are telling R to plot month on the x axis and burnt area on the y axis. We have not yet told R how we want to represent the data though, so our data will not yet be plotted.


```{r, fig.asp = 3/4, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

```

```{r fig.asp = 3/4, fig.cap = 'Our variables are now assigned to the x and y axes but nothing is plotted yet', message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = fires,
       aes(x = MONTH, y = BAREA)) 
```

### Geometry layer {-}

Geometric objects, or `geoms`, determine the visual representation of your data. We can begin by plotting our data points as a scatter plot, to see how month and burnt area relate to each other.

```{r fig.asp = 3/4, fig.cap = '`geom_point()` plots the data as points!', message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = fires,
       aes(x = MONTH, y = BAREA)) +
    geom_point()
```
> Note that you can add several `geoms` in one plot. For example, we could add a line on this plot to show a threshold value, or add a linear regression. But for now, let us keep it simple! 

> Also note that we can pass the `aes()` arguments inside the `ggplot()` call, just beside the `data`. In this case, those aesthetics will apply to all the `geoms` that are included in that visualization. But we can also pass it within the `geom` function. In this case, each `geom` will have its own aesthetics, which will need to be explicitely defined for each of them.  

 
## Basic plots with `ggplot2` {-}

The `geoms` are the fundamental building blocks of ggplot2. The allow us to decide in which way we want to picture out our data. As you can see, most of these geoms are associated with a named plot: when that geom is used by itself in a plot, that plot has a special name.

*   `geom_area()` draws an __area plot__, which is a line plot filled to the y-axis (filled lines). Multiple groups will be stacked on top of each other. 
  
*   `geom_bar(stat = "identity")` makes a __bar chart__. We need `stat = "identity"` because the default stat automatically counts values (so is essentially a 1d geom). 
    The identity stat leaves the data unchanged. Multiple bars in the same location will be stacked on top of one another.
  
*   `geom_line()` makes a __line plot__.  The `group` aesthetic determines which observations are connected. `geom_line()` connects points from left to right; `geom_path()` is similar but connects points in the order they appear in the data.
    Both `geom_line()` and `geom_path()` also understand the aesthetic `linetype`, which maps a categorical variable to solid, dotted and dashed lines.
    
*   `geom_point()` produces a __scatterplot__. `geom_point()` also understands the `shape` aesthetic.

*   `geom_polygon()` draws polygons, which are filled paths. Each vertex of the polygon requires a separate row in the data.  It is often useful to merge a data frame of polygon coordinates with the data just prior to plotting.

*   `geom_rect()`, `geom_tile()` and `geom_raster()` draw rectangles. `geom_rect()` is parameterised by the four corners of the rectangle, `xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax` and `ymax`. `geom_tile()` is exactly the same, but parameterised by the center of the rect and its size, `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`. `geom_raster()` is a fast special case of `geom_tile()` used when all the tiles are the same size.

The most common `geoms` are shown in the code below.

```{r}

df <- data.frame(
  x = c(3, 1, 5), 
  y = c(2, 4, 6), 
  label = c("a","b","c")
)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y, label = label)) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)  # Hide axis label
 

p1 <- p + geom_point() + ggtitle("point")
p2 <- p + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + ggtitle("bar")
p3 <- p + geom_line() + ggtitle("line")
p4 <- p + geom_polygon() + ggtitle("polygon")
p5 <- p + geom_area() + ggtitle("area")
p6 <- p + geom_tile() + ggtitle("raster")

p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)


```




```{r echo=FALSE}


```


Each of these geoms is two dimensional and requires both `x` and `y` aesthetics. That means we must `map` two variables at least, one to each dimension. Nonetheless, we coudl have included additional aesthetics such as `color`/`fill` (or `color`) and `size`. We will cover all of them in the next sections.


## Adding dimensions to a figure through aesthetics {-}

Once we know what we want to plot, we must define the chosen geom, and define the aesthetics. Some of these aesthetics will be mandatory, whereas others can be optional. The number and type of aesthetics wull also be different for each `geom`. For instance, `geom_point()`requires, at minimum, a variables parsed into the `x` and another one into the `y`. It can hold additional aesthetics though, such as the `shape`, `size` and `color` of the points.

Let's make color to vary with fire cause:

```{r fig.asp = 3/4, fig.cap = 'ggplot automatically adds each aesthetic to the legend (except from x and y)', message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = fires,
       aes(x = MONTH, y = BAREA, color = CAUSE)) +
    geom_point()
```

We could further add new aesthetics to the figure, such as shape or size:

```{r fig.asp = 3/4, fig.cap = 'ggplot automatically adds each aesthetic to the legend (except from x and y)', message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = fires,
       aes(x = MONTH, y = BAREA, color = CCAA, shape = CAUSE)) +
    geom_point()
```

However, the fact that we *can* add as many aesthetics as we wish, does not mean we *should* do it. The example above is quite clear: the overlapping between the points and the huge amount of colors prevents getting any insight from that chart.

::: exercise
**EXERCISE 1:**</br> 
1.1 Make a figure showing the annual variation in the number of fires. What do you observe? </br>
1.2 Correct some of the problems you have found in the graph above, and use some *aesthetic* to identify the cause of the fire.
:::




## Fixed aesthetics {-}

What if we want to change point shape or size, but we don't want to make them depend on any variable? We can do it quite easily. Aesthetics such as color, alpha (transparency), shape, and size  can be set outside of `aes()` values, and will be static, not data-dependent. However, we must define their value. Here, for example `color`, `size` and `alpha`are not conveying any information in the data - they are just choices we have made to make a prettier plot. Obviously, these *fixed* aesthetics must be parsed into each of the geoms.

```{r fig.asp = 3/4, fig.cap = "Note how the fixed aesthetics are not plotted into the legend", message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = fires,
       aes(x = MONTH, y = BAREA, color = CAUSE)) +
    geom_point(color = "blue", size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5)
```

You can learn more on the available aesthetics (and their possibe values) in the [`ggplot2 website`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html)

# ggplot2 and the tidyverse {-}

As already mentioned, `ggplot2` is a member of the tidyverse, thus it has being designed to be operable from `dplyr` pipelines. That means we can use any number of verbs to manipulate a data frame and then pass it to `ggplot()` using `%>%`. Pbviously, if we proceed in this way, there is no need to specify the `data` argument within the `ggplot()` call. After that we keep using the regular `+` operator to concatenate plot instructions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data.frame %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=variable)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

::: exercise
**EXERCISE 3:**</br> 
Combine `dplyr` and `ggplot` functions into a pipeline to generate a figure showing the number of fires in each Autonomous Region since 1990.

# A breakdown of common layers {-}

Here is a breakdown of each Grammar of Graphics layer and common arguments for each. Do not worry for now, we will see each of these elements. The list that can be used as a reference:

* **Data**:
    * your data, in tidy format, will provide ingredients for your plot
    * use `dplyr` techniques to prepare data for optimal plotting format
    * usually, this means you should have one row for every observation that you want to plot
* **Aesthetics** (aes), to make data visible
    * `x`, `y`: variable along the x and y axis
    * `color`: color of geoms according to data
    * `fill`: the inside color of the geom
    * `group`: what group a geom belongs to
    * `shape`: the figure used to plot a point
    * `linetype`: the type of line used (solid, dashed, etc)
    * `size`: size scaling for an extra dimension
    * `alpha`: the transparency of the geom
* **Geometric objects** (geoms - determines the type of plot)
    * `geom_point()`: scatterplot
    * `geom_line()`: lines connecting points by increasing value of x
    * `geom_path()`: lines connecting points in sequence of appearance
    * `geom_boxplot()`: box and whiskers plot for categorical variables
    * `geom_bar()`: bar charts for categorical x axis
    * `geom_histogram()`: histogram for continuous x axis
    * `geom_violin()`: distribution kernel of data dispersion
    * `geom_smooth()`: function line based on data
* **Facets**
    * `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` for small multiples
* **Statistics**
    * similar to geoms, but computed
    * show means, counts, and other statistical summaries of data
* **Coordinates** - fitting data onto a page
    * `coord_cartesian` to set limits
    * `coord_polar` for circular plots
    * `coord_map` for different map projections
* **Themes**
    * overall visual defaults
    * fonts, colors, shapes, outlines


# To know more {-}

Of course, as any other `package` within the `tidyverse`, there is a lot of documentation and resources to back us up during the learning process. Take a loof at the [reference guide](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) from the tidyverse site, visit the [sthda website](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials) or check `ggplot2`'s cheatsheet:
